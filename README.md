Footy is an app that allows the user find soccer players by their attributes. Ex: 'I need to find a midfielder that is good scoring free kicks'.

It shows transfer history, attributes, seasons numbers etc.
Also it has a chat that would be used by the club agents.

And works with firebase as main backend.

I made this application aiming learn react native by myself. I learned things as I needed achieve something in the application.

It has many things I don't like but i think it's was pretty nice for a 1st application of someone with zero knoledge about JS or RN.
